Introduction
Cartoonify is a Python project that aims to transform regular images into cartoon-like representations. This project uses OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, to apply various image processing techniques to achieve the cartoon effect. By adjusting parameters and thresholds, users can control the level of abstraction and stylization in the generated cartoon images.

Installation
To use the Cartoonify project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/username/cartoonify.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd cartoonify
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you have Python and OpenCV installed on your system before proceeding with the installation.

Usage
Place the image you want to cartoonify in the project directory.
Open the cartoonify.py script in a text editor.
Modify the input_image_path variable to specify the path to your input image.
Optionally, adjust the parameters such as num_down, num_bilateral, and threshold_color to achieve the desired cartoon effect.
Save the script and run it using the command: python cartoonify.py.
The generated cartoon image will be saved in the project directory.
Feel free to experiment with different parameter values to create unique and customized cartoon images.
